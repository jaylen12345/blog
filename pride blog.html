			<p>In the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, violent protests and street demonstrations took over the streets of New York after a police raid of Stonewall Inn, the now-legendary Greenwich Village gay bar.

			<p>Our first Queens Pride march was held in 1993, and since, our parade and festival have grown tremendously. We now attract more than 40,000 spectators and are the second largest Pride celebration in the New York metropolitan area. Queens Pride continues to promote the visibility and accomplishments of the LGBT community and to foster acceptance by the many cultures and religions represented in our borough.

In addition to the parade and festival, our group works to foster youth, cultural, and social programming and to engage our elected officials on issues pertinent to the LGBT community. We host various programs, community outreach and our Winter Pride Dinner Dance.</p>

The American Civil Liberties Union, Brooke Guinan (trans woman, FDNY firefighter), Krishna Stone (Director of Community Relations, GMHC), and Geng Le (Founder, Blued) helmed 2017's iconic March.

The marches in New York and other cities are spotlighting resistance to what participants see as new pressure on gay rights, while contending with the prospect of protests over the events' own diversity and direction.

In a year when leaders are anxious about President Donald Trump's agenda, both the New York and San Francisco events were headed by groups more focused on protest than celebration.</p>
